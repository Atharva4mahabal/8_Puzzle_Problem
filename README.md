# 8_Puzzle_Problem
A 3 by 3 board with 8 tiles (each tile has a number from 1 to 8) and a single empty space is provided. The goal is to use the vacant space to arrange the numbers on the tiles such that they match the final arrangement. Four neighbouring (left, right, above, and below) tiles can be moved into the available area.
