The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle that is played on a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective of the game is to rearrange the tiles from their initial configuration into a target or goal configuration by sliding them one at a time into the empty space. The tiles can only be moved into adjacent empty spaces (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally), and the empty space can only be occupied by a single tile at a time.

The initial configuration and target configuration can vary, but typically, the initial configuration is a randomly shuffled arrangement of the eight tiles, and the target configuration is the tiles arranged in ascending order, usually from 1 to 8, with the empty space at a specific location.

The 8-puzzle is a simple yet challenging game that requires problem-solving and strategy to find a solution, and it has been used as a benchmark problem in the study of artificial intelligence and search algorithms, including the A* search algorithm. It's a popular puzzle that can be found in various forms in puzzle books, mobile apps, and educational settings.
